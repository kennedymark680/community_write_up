### Description

Welcome to Community Write-Up, the place were you can view and share aircraft discrepancies with a community of pilots.

The goal of Community Write-Up is to improve the working knowledge of a community of pilots. We all know that a fleet of aircraft are bound to have issues and those issues often times repeat themselves in other aircraft. One individual pilot may find an discrepancy, then communicate directly with a mechanic, often times this is where the communications stops.

Community Write-Up changes this, and changes the away information is shared. When a pilot sees a issue, they can post it to the webpage for everyone to see. Instead of only one issue for one pilot, now its one issue for every pilot to see. Your group will learn as a whole from each and ever circumstance.
